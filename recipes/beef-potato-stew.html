    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Carne con papas (Meat with potatoes) is a traditional Mexican stew made with beef and potatoes cooked in a tasty sauce made of
        tomatoes, garlic, onions, and peppers. This popular meat and potatoes dish tastes great when served with rice
        and tortillas and is a classic Mexican comfort food.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike European beef stews, this has a tomato sauce base, which gives it a lovely, slightly sweet, acidic
        brightness. The peppers and Mexican spices in the broth create a unique flavor profile that tastes great on a
        cold winter day and marries well with authentic Mexican rice, cilantro lime rice, or just some plain white rice
        and warm flour tortillas.
