    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian baked pasta dish made with layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, alternating with fillings, and then baked. The fillings typically include cheese, tomato sauce, and meat, such as ragù or ground beef. Other common ingredients include vegetables, béchamel sauce, and eggs. The dish is often topped with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.

        Lasagna has ancient origins and many regional variations. Traditional recipes often use Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, béchamel sauce, and ragù, a meat-based sauce. However, there are many different recipes that can be made, such as adding Italian sausage, sugar, or cottage cheese.
